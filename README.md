# C-Gravity
Gravity visualization simulation in C using OpenGL

This simulation implements the "Runge-Kutta-Fhelberg method" for approximating solutions to Ordinary Differential Equations (Newton's Law of Graviational Attraction being an ODE)
Implenetation is dervivied from "LOW-ORDER CLASSICAL RUNGE-KUTTA FORMULAS WITH STEPSIZE CONTROL AND THEIR APPLICATION TO SOME HEAT TRANSFER PROBLEMS" by Erwin Fhelberg 1969 and can be found at:
https://ntrs.nasa.gov/api/citations/19690021375/downloads/19690021375.pdf

Coefficients used in the algorithm can also be found in the above, though one may find it easier to locate these references at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta%E2%80%93Fehlberg_method

Work in progress, gods speed if you try to build/run this on your PC in its current state. 

Examples: 

Please excuse the choppy lighting in the below examples for now, it is much smoother when I am running it versus how it comes out in the recordings, but I plan to redo lighting and add textures in the future which will *hopefully* make better videos.

Zoom in to show there are moon orbits:
